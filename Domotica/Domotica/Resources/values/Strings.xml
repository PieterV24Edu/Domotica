	For connection instructions	go to the FAQ in the menu.\n
	You can read the sensorvalues (temperature and light) and set threshholds which are connected to the switches. These instructions are also written in the FAQ.

	<string name="FAQText">

<b>1.	To make connection simply tap the ‘connection’ button on the menu. </b>\n
-	Enter ip-adress of the arduino \n
-	Enter port-number of the arduino  \n
\n
In order to make connection click the connectbutton.\n
The text will indicate if the connection succeeded.\n
\n
<b>2.	To control your switches open switches in menu (yes! It’s that easy!) </b>\n
-	You can toggle the switches by using the switchbuttons \n
-	‘Refresh switches’ to refresh the state of the switches \n
\n
<b>3.	 Open sensors in menu to get sensorvalues of the temperature Sensor and light sensor. You can update the values by manually pressing the “REFRESH SENSORS” button or you can automatticly update the sensorvalues by toggle the “Toggle Refresh” toggleswitch.</b> \n
\n
<b>4.	Open “sensor Threshold” to manually activate a switch by enter a threshhold value for a sensor. Click the + to add an entry. </b> \n
